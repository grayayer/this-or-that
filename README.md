- **Scraper Tool**: `scraper/` - Automated data collection from Land-book.com

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

The application includes comprehensive performance optimizations for fast loading and smooth user experience:

### 1. Service Worker Caching (DISABLED)

**Note**: Service worker functionality has been disabled due to development complexity and image loading issues. While the service worker implementation (`sw.js`) remains available for reference, it is not active by default.

**Reasons for disabling**:

- Caused image loading problems during development
- Added significant debugging complexity
- Cache management became problematic for iterative development
- Performance benefits didn't outweigh development overhead

**Alternative caching**: The application now relies on standard browser caching and the image optimizer for performance improvements.

### 2. Image Optimization (`js/image-optimizer.js`)

- **WebP Format Support**: Automatic WebP detection and conversion
- **Image Compression**: Canvas-based compression for better performance
- **Responsive Images**: Multiple sizes generated for different screen sizes
- **CDN Optimization**: URL optimization for Land-book CDN
- **Lazy Loading**: Images loaded only when needed
- **Preloading**: Next images preloaded in background for smooth transitions

### 3. JavaScript Bundle Optimization

- **Memory Monitoring**: Automatic memory usage tracking and warnings
- **Enhanced Loading States**: Smooth transitions between loading states
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling with retry mechanisms
- **Performance Metrics**: Built-in performance monitoring and reporting

### 4. Smooth Animations and Transitions

- **GPU Acceleration**: Hardware-accelerated animations using `transform: translateZ(0)`
- **Cubic-Bezier Easing**: Smooth, natural animation curves
- **Staggered Animations**: Results appear with elegant timing
- **Reduced Motion Support**: Respects user accessibility preferences
- **Performance-Optimized**: Animations optimized for 60fps on all devices

### Performance Features

- **Connection-Aware**: Reduces animations and effects on slow connections
- **Battery-Conscious**: Minimal animations for users with low battery
- **High-DPI Optimization**: Enhanced rendering for retina displays
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup and optimization
- **Network Status Monitoring**: Real-time connection status tracking

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (for local server)
- Modern web browser with service worker support
- Node.js (optional, for advanced development)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd this-or-that
   ```

2. **Start local server**

   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. **Open application**

   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

### Development Tools

- **Cache Manager**: `http://localhost:8000/cache-manager.html` - Manage caches and storage
- **Performance Tests**: `http://localhost:8000/test-performance-optimizations.html`
- **Debug Tools**: Various test pages for component testing

## üêõ Debugging and Cache Management

### Common Cache Issues

**Note**: With service worker disabled, cache issues are significantly reduced. However, standard browser caching can still occasionally cause problems:

#### Symptoms

- Changes not appearing after refresh (rare with service worker disabled)
- Old JavaScript code still running
- Outdated design data loading

#### Solutions

**Method 1: Cache Manager (Recommended)**

1. Open `http://localhost:8000/cache-manager.html`
2. Click "Complete Reset" to clear everything
3. Refresh the main application

**Method 2: Chrome DevTools**

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Click "Storage" in left sidebar
4. Click "Clear site data"
5. Refresh the page

**Method 3: Manual Clearing**

1. Chrome DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Storage
2. Clear each individually:
   - Service Workers: Unregister
   - Cache Storage: Delete all caches
   - Local Storage: Clear
   - Session Storage: Clear

**Method 4: Incognito Mode**

- Open application in incognito/private browsing mode
- Bypasses all caches for clean testing

### Development Best Practices

1. **Use Cache Manager**: Bookmark `cache-manager.html` for quick access
2. **Incognito Testing**: Test major changes in incognito mode first
3. **Version Parameters**: Scripts include `?v=1` parameters to bust cache
4. **Service Worker**: Can be disabled in `index.html` for development

### Cache Management Commands

```javascript
// Clear all caches programmatically
caches.keys().then(names => {
    names.forEach(name => caches.delete(name));
});

// Clear local storage
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();

// Unregister service worker
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistration().then(reg => {
    if (reg) reg.unregister();
});
```

## üìä Testing

### Test Pages

- `test-performance-optimizations.html` - Performance feature testing
- `test-enhanced-error-handling.html` - Error handling validation
- `test-mobile-enhancements.html` - Mobile-specific features
- `test-results-display.html` - Results generation testing
- `working-app.html` - Simplified version for debugging

### Running Tests

1. Start local server: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
2. Navigate to test pages: `http://localhost:8000/test-*.html`
3. Check browser console for detailed test results

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

The application can be configured through the app initialization:

```javascript
await initializeApp({
    dataPath: 'data/designs.json',           // Primary data source
    fallbackDataPath: 'data/sample-designs.json', // Fallback data
    enableLogging: true,                     // Console logging
    timerDuration: 15,                       // Choice timer (seconds)
    minChoicesRequired: 20                   // Minimum choices for results
});
```

### Service Worker Configuration

Cache names and strategies can be modified in `sw.js`:

```javascript
const CACHE_NAME = 'this-or-that-v1.0.0';
const STATIC_CACHE_NAME = 'this-or-that-static-v1.0.0';
const DYNAMIC_CACHE_NAME = 'this-or-that-dynamic-v1.0.0';
```

## üì± Browser Support

### Minimum Requirements

- Chrome 60+, Firefox 55+, Safari 11+, Edge 79+
- Service Worker support
- ES6+ JavaScript features
- CSS Grid and Flexbox support

### Progressive Enhancement
