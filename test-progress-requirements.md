## Requirements Verification

### Requirement 3.1: Display a progress indicator showing current choice number

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

- Progress text shows "Choice X of 20+ (Y more needed for results)"
- Updates dynamically with each selection
- Located in `.progress-text` element

### Requirement 3.2: Show the total number of choices completed

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

- Progress text displays current choice number
- Visual progress bar shows percentage completion
- Both update in real-time with selections

### Requirement 3.3: Indicate when results will be available

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

- Progress text changes to "Choice X completed - Results available!" when minimum reached
- Progress section gets visual highlighting with green background
- Progress bar changes color and glows when threshold reached

### Requirement 3.4: When 20 choices completed, ask if user wants another 20, enable access to results if not, repeat up to 2 more times

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

- `shouldShowResults()` triggers prompt at 20, 40, 60 choices
- `showContinuePrompt()` creates dynamic UI asking user to continue or see results
- Supports up to 3 sessions (60 total choices maximum)
- Session tracking with `appState.currentSession` and `appState.maxSessions`
- Continue button hidden after maximum sessions reached

## Implementation Details

### Core Functions

- `updateProgressDisplay()` - Updates progress text and visual indicators
- `shouldShowResults()` - Determines when to show continue prompt
- `showContinuePrompt()` - Creates and displays continue/results choice UI
- `handleContinueChoices()` - Processes user choice to continue
- `handleShowResults()` - Processes user choice to see results

### Visual Enhancements

- Progress bar changes color when threshold reached

- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Smooth transitions and animations

### State Management

- `appState.totalRounds` - Total choices across all sessions
- `appState.currentSession` - Current session number (1-3)
- `appState.minChoicesRequired` - Minimum choices needed (20)
- `appState.maxSessions` - Maximum sessions allowed (3)

## Test Results

### Automated Test Results

```
✅ Progress percentage increases correctly (5% per selection)
✅ Remaining choices decrease correctly
✅ At 20 selections, canShowResults becomes true
✅ Progress reaches 100% at minimum threshold
✅ Reset functionality works correctly
```
